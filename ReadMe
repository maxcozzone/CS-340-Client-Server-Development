Writing Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Programs
To ensure programs are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, it's crucial to use modular design, clear naming conventions, and thorough documentation. Modular design allows 
breaking down the program into smaller, reusable components, making the codebase easier to manage and modify. Descriptive naming conventions and comments enhance readability 
and understanding. For the CRUD Python module from Project One, 
this approach allowed seamless integration with the dashboard widgets in Project Two, demonstrating the advantages of modularity, reusability, and maintainability. 
Future projects can benefit similarly by leveraging this CRUD module for various database interactions.

Approach to Problem-Solving as a Computer Scientist
As a computer scientist, tackling a problem involves understanding requirements, designing a solution, implementing the code, testing thoroughly, and iterating 
based on feedback. For the Grazioso Salvare project, this approach was applied by carefully analyzing database and dashboard needs, designing the CRUD module for MongoDB 
interactions, and integrating it with the dashboard to provide a seamless user experience. Compared to previous assignments, this project demanded a more structured and 
systematic approach, focusing on real-world application and client-specific needs.

Creating Databases to Meet Client Requests
Creating databases for clients involves detailed requirement analysis, prototyping, iterative development, and scalable design. Understanding the client's needs through 
discussions and validating them with prototypes ensures alignment. An iterative approach allows for continuous improvement based on feedback. Designing databases to be scalable
and flexible accommodates future changes and growth. These strategies ensure that the final product meets client expectations effectively.

Role of Computer Scientists and Impact on Companies
Computer scientists develop software solutions that solve real-world problems, automate tasks, manage data, and drive innovation. Their work significantly impacts companies by 
improving efficiency and enabling data-driven decision-making. In the Grazioso Salvare project, the developed dashboard helps the company manage animal shelter data efficiently, 
allowing them to focus more on rescuing and caring for animals. This project demonstrates how effective software solutions can streamline operations and support the core mission of organizations.
